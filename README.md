Go Fastly is a Golang API client for interacting with most facets of the
[Fastly API](https://docs.fastly.com/api).

## Installation

This is a client library, so there is nothing to install. But, it uses Go modules,
so you must be running Go 1.11 or higher.

## Usage

```go
import "github.com/fastly/go-fastly/v3/fastly"
```

## Migrating from v1 to v2

The move from major version [1][v1] to [2][v2] has resulted in a couple of fundamental changes to the library:

- Consistent field name format for IDs and Versions (e.g. `DictionaryID`, `PoolID`, `ServiceID`, `ServiceVersion` etc).
- Input struct fields (for write/update operations) that are optional (i.e. `omitempty`) and use basic types, are now defined as pointers.

The move to more consistent field names in some cases will have resulted in the corresponding sentinel error name to be updated also. For example, `ServiceID` has resulted in a change from `ErrMissingService` to `ErrMissingServiceID`.

The change in type for [basic types](https://tour.golang.org/basics/11) that are optional on input structs related to write/update operations is designed to avoid unexpected behaviours when dealing with their zero value (see [this reference](https://willnorris.com/2014/05/go-rest-apis-and-pointers/) for more details). As part of this change we now provide [helper functions](./fastly/basictypes_helper.go) to assist with generating the new pointer types required.

> Note: some read/list operations require fields to be provided but if omitted a zero value will be used when marshaling the data structure into JSON. This too can cause confusion, which is why some input structs define their mandatory fields as pointers (to ensure that the backend can distinguish between a zero value and an omitted field).

## Migrating from v2 to v3

There were a few breaking changes introduced in [`v3.0.0`][v3]:

1. A new `FieldError` abstraction for validating API struct fields.
2. Changing some mandatory fields to Optional (and vice-versa) to better support more _practical_ API usage.
3. Avoid generic ID field when more explicit naming would be clearer.

## Examples

Fastly's API is designed to work in the following manner:

1. Create (or clone) a new configuration version for the service
2. Make any changes to the version
3. Validate the version
4. Activate the version

This flow using the Golang client looks like this:

```go
// Create a client object. The client has no state, so it can be persisted
// and re-used. It is also safe to use concurrently due to its lack of state.
// There is also a DefaultClient() method that reads an environment variable.
// Please see the documentation for more information and details.
client, err := fastly.NewClient("YOUR_FASTLY_API_KEY")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// You can find the service ID in the Fastly web console.
var serviceID = "SERVICE_ID"

// We'll get the latest 'active' version by inspecting the service metadata and 
// then finding which available version is the 'active' version.
service, err := client.GetService(&fastly.GetServiceInput{
  ID: serviceID,
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// Let's acquire a service version to clone from. We'll start by searching for 
// the latest 'active' version available, and if there are no active versions, 
// then we'll clone from whatever is the latest version.
latest := service.Versions[len(service.Versions)-1]
for _, version := range service.Versions {
  if version.Active {
    latest = version.Number
    break
  }
}

// Clone the latest 'active' version so we can make changes without affecting 
// the active configuration.
version, err := client.CloneVersion(&fastly.CloneVersionInput{
  ServiceID:      serviceID,
  ServiceVersion: latest,
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// Now you can make any changes to the new version. In this example, we will add
// a new domain.
domain, err := client.CreateDomain(&fastly.CreateDomainInput{
  ServiceID:      serviceID,
  ServiceVersion: version.Number,
  Name:           "example.com",
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// Output: "example.com"
fmt.Println(domain.Name)

// And we will also add a new backend.
backend, err := client.CreateBackend(&fastly.CreateBackendInput{
  ServiceID:      serviceID,
  ServiceVersion: version.Number,
  Name:           "example-backend",
  Address:        "127.0.0.1",
  Port:           80,
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// Output: "example-backend"
fmt.Println(backend.Name)

// Now we can validate that our version is valid.
valid, _, err := client.ValidateVersion(&fastly.ValidateVersionInput{
  ServiceID:      serviceID,
  ServiceVersion: version.Number,
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
if !valid {
  log.Fatal("not valid version")
}

// Finally, activate this new version.
activeVersion, err := client.ActivateVersion(&fastly.ActivateVersionInput{
  ServiceID:      serviceID,
  ServiceVersion: version.Number,
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// Output: true
fmt.Printf("%t\n", activeVersion.Locked)
```

## Developing

1. Clone the project to your preferred directory, using your preferred method.
2. Download the module and accompanying developer tooling.

  ```bash
  $ go mod download
  ```

3. Make changes.
4. Verify those changes.

  ```bash
  $ make all
  ```

## Testing

Go Fastly uses [go-vcr](https://github.com/dnaeon/go-vcr) to "record" and "replay" API request fixtures to improve the speed and portability of integration tests. The test suite uses a single test service ID for all test fixtures.

Contributors without access to the test service can still update the fixtures but with some additional steps required. Below is an example workflow for updating a set of fixture files (where `...` should be replaced with an appropriate value):

```sh
# Remove all yaml fixture files from the specified directory.
#
rm -r fastly/fixtures/.../*

# Run a subsection of the tests.
# This will cause the deleted fixtures to be recreated.
# 
# FASTLY_TEST_SERVICE_ID: should correspond to a real service you control.
# FASTLY_API_KEY: should be a real token associated with the Service you control.
# TESTARGS: allows you to use the -run flag of the 'go test' command.
# 
make test FASTLY_TEST_SERVICE_ID="..." FASTLY_API_KEY="..." TESTARGS="-run=..."
```

> **NOTE**: to run the tests with go-vcr disabled, set `VCR_DISABLE=1` (`make test-full` does this).

When adding or updating client code and integration tests, contributors should record a new set of fixtures. Before submitting a pull request with new or updated fixtures, we ask that contributors update them to use the default service ID by running `make fix-fixtures` with `FASTLY_TEST_SERVICE_ID` set to the same value used to run your tests.

```sh
make fix-fixtures FASTLY_TEST_SERVICE_ID="..."
```

### Important Test Tips!

There are two important things external contributors need to do when running the tests:

1. Use a 'temporary' token for running the tests (only if regenerating the token fixtures).
2. Redact sensitive information in your fixtures.

You only need to use a temporary token when regenerating the 'token' fixtures. This is because there is a test to validate the _revoking_ of a token using the [`/tokens/self`](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/auth/#revoke-token-current) API endpoint, for which running this test (if there are no existing fixtures) will cause the token you provided at your command-line shell to be revoked/expired. So please don't use a token that's also used by a real/running application! Otherwise you'll discover those application may stop working as you've inadvertently caused your token to be revoked.

In general, any time you regenerate fixtures you should be sure to redact any sensitive information served back from the API, but specifically there is a test which _creates_ tokens that needs special attention: when regenerating the token fixtures this will require you to enter your actual account credentials (i.e. username/password) into the `token_test.go` file. You'll want to ensure that once the fixtures are create that you redact those values from both the generated fixture as well as the go test file itself. For example...

```go
input := &CreateTokenInput{
	Name:     "my-test-token",
	Scope:    "global",
	Username: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
	Password: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
}
```
