Go Fastly is a Golang API client for interacting with most facets of the
[Fastly API](https://docs.fastly.com/api).

## Installation

This is a client library, so there is nothing to install. But, it uses Go modules,
so you must be running Go 1.11 or higher.

## Usage

```go
import "github.com/fastly/go-fastly/v2/fastly"
```

## Migrating from v1 to v2

The move from major version [1][v1] to [2][v2] has resulted in a couple of fundamental changes to the library:

- Consistent field name format for IDs and Versions (e.g. `DictionaryID`, `PoolID`, `ServiceID`, `ServiceVersion` etc).
- Input struct fields (for write/update operations) that are optional (i.e. `omitempty`) and use basic types, are now defined as pointers.

The move to more consistent field names in some cases will have resulted in the corresponding sentinel error name to be updated also. For example, `ServiceID` has resulted in a change from `ErrMissingService` to `ErrMissingServiceID`.

The change in type for [basic types](https://tour.golang.org/basics/11) that are optional on input structs related to write/update operations is designed to avoid unexpected behaviours when dealing with their zero value (see [this reference](https://willnorris.com/2014/05/go-rest-apis-and-pointers/) for more details). As part of this change we now provide [helper functions](./fastly/basictypes_helper.go) to assist with generating the new pointer types required.

## Examples

Fastly's API is designed to work in the following manner:

1. Create (or clone) a new configuration version for the service
2. Make any changes to the version
3. Validate the version
4. Activate the version

This flow using the Golang client looks like this:

```go
// Create a client object. The client has no state, so it can be persisted
// and re-used. It is also safe to use concurrently due to its lack of state.
// There is also a DefaultClient() method that reads an environment variable.
// Please see the documentation for more information and details.
client, err := fastly.NewClient("YOUR_FASTLY_API_KEY")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// You can find the service ID in the Fastly web console.
var serviceID = "SERVICE_ID"

// Get the latest active version
latest, err := client.LatestVersion(&fastly.LatestVersionInput{
  ServiceID: serviceID,
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// Clone the latest version so we can make changes without affecting the
// active configuration.
version, err := client.CloneVersion(&fastly.CloneVersionInput{
  ServiceID:      serviceID,
  ServiceVersion: latest.Number,
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// Now you can make any changes to the new version. In this example, we will add
// a new domain.
domain, err := client.CreateDomain(&fastly.CreateDomainInput{
  ServiceID:      serviceID,
  ServiceVersion: version.Number,
  Name:           "example.com",
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// Output: "example.com"
fmt.Println(domain.Name)

// And we will also add a new backend.
backend, err := client.CreateBackend(&fastly.CreateBackendInput{
  ServiceID:      serviceID,
  ServiceVersion: version.Number,
  Name:           "example-backend",
  Address:        "127.0.0.1",
  Port:           80,
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// Output: "example-backend"
fmt.Println(backend.Name)

// Now we can validate that our version is valid.
valid, _, err := client.ValidateVersion(&fastly.ValidateVersionInput{
  ServiceID:      serviceID,
  ServiceVersion: version.Number,
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
if !valid {
  log.Fatal("not valid version")
}

// Finally, activate this new version.
activeVersion, err := client.ActivateVersion(&fastly.ActivateVersionInput{
  ServiceID:      serviceID,
  ServiceVersion: version.Number,
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// Output: true
fmt.Printf("%t\n", activeVersion.Locked)
```

## Developing

1. Clone the project to your preferred directory, using your preferred method.
2. Download the module and accompanying developer tooling.

  ```bash
  $ go mod download
  ```

3. Make changes.
4. Verify those changes.

  ```bash
  $ make all
  ```

## Testing

Go Fastly uses [go-vcr](https://github.com/dnaeon/go-vcr) to "record" and
"replay" API request fixtures to improve the speed and portability of
integration tests. The test suite uses a single test service ID for all test
fixtures.

Contributors _without_ access to the test service can disable go-vcr, set a
different test service ID, and use their own API credentials by setting the
following environment variables:
* `VCR_DISABLE`: disables go-vcr fixture recording and replay
  * The `test-full` make target runs the tests with go-vcr disabled.
* `FASTLY_TEST_SERVICE_ID`: set default service ID used by the test suite
  * **NOTE: A quick way to create a resource for testing is to use the following [Fastly CLI](https://github.com/fastly/cli) command:**
  ```
  $ fastly service create --type=vcl --name=foo
  ```
* `FASTLY_API_KEY`: set a Fastly API key to be used by the test suite

```sh
make test-full \
  FASTLY_TEST_SERVICE_ID="SERVICEID" \
  FASTLY_API_KEY="TESTAPIKEY" \
  TESTARGS="-run=Logentries"
```

When adding or updating client code and integration tests, contributors may
record a new set of fixtures by running the tests without `VCR_DISABLE`. Before
submitting a pull request with new or updated fixtures, we ask that contributors
update them to use the default service ID by running `make fix-fixtures` with
`FASTLY_TEST_SERVICE_ID` set to the same value used to run your tests.

If you are **updating** an existing resource, in order to force go-vcr to re-record,
rather than use the existing recorded values, you will have to removed the recorded
values for that resource via `rm -r fastly/fixtures/<resource_name>`. **If you don't
remove the existing recorded values, you will see the following error**:

```
Post "https://api.fastly.com/service/SERVICEID/version": Requested interaction not found
```

Example (`make test`, `make fix-fixtures`):
```sh
make test \
  FASTLY_TEST_SERVICE_ID="SERVICEID" \
  FASTLY_API_KEY="TESTAPIKEY" \
  TESTARGS="-run=Logentries"
make fix-fixtures

# Re-run test suite with newly recorded fixtures
unset FASTLY_TEST_SERVICE_ID FASTLY_API_KEY
make test
```
